# Assumptions:
## Tanks:
Tanks return fixed because the real ones would be able to calculate the weight on the fly.
If I would manipulate those values programatically there could be a situation where
Coffee Machine set some value and the user refilled/emptied the tank and the value in the
program would become inappropriate.
